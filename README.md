# B573 Assignment 3: Advanced Python

## Programming Language: Python

## Date: October 5, 2023

## Description:

This repository is designed to utilize numpy and pandas for data handling as well as getting additional practice with fundamental commands in base Python. Additionally, this repository focuses on creating graphs of many kinds using matplotlibu and seaborn and understanding the paramters available in these libraries to present a professional and publishable graph. This repository will utilize the Fibonacci sequence and the related sequences derived from it that were created in Assignment 2. Additionally, a Titanic dataset from Kaggle will be utilized to create graphs.
### Required Files

<code>gender_submission.csv</code>  one of three required files to get the Titanic dataset

<code>test.csv</code>  second of three required files to get the Titanic dataset

<code>train.csv</code>  third of three required files to get the Titanic dataset

<code>assignment_3.1.py</code>   creates functions for fibonacci and related sequences and then graphs these

<code>assignment_3.2.py</code>   creates many different graphs based on the Titanic survivorship


### Required Packages

matplotlib

pandas

seaborn


### Execution

<ins>Steps to Run the Script</ins>

1. Clone repository

2. Change working directory to location of files

    ```
    cd path/to/files
    ```

3. Run the scripts using the following commands: 

    ```
    python assignment_3.1.py 
    python assignment_3.2.py
    ```

4. Each script will output results in the command line.

    a. Each graph will require you to close the window for the next graph to be displayed.
